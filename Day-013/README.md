> **Story of Prophet Musa and Khidr as mentioned in Surah Al-Kahf (The Cave):**

## i Details
One day, Prophet Musa (Moses) was speaking to Allah and expressed his desire to meet someone who was more knowledgeable than him. Allah informed Musa of a man named Khidr who had knowledge that Allah had granted him, and that he should seek him out to learn from him.

Musa set out on his journey and eventually found Khidr. Musa asked Khidr if he could accompany him on his journey and learn from him, and Khidr agreed on the condition that Musa wouldn't question anything that he did until he explained the reason behind it.

The two men began their journey and eventually came across a river where they saw a group of people in a boat. Khidr asked the men if they could give them a ride, but they refused because they feared that the boat would sink due to the heavy weight of Khidr and Musa. Khidr then proceeded to make a hole in the boat and sink it, much to Musa's surprise and confusion.

Khidr explained to Musa that the boat belonged to poor fishermen who were struggling to make ends meet. He also revealed that there was an oppressive king who was seizing all boats, so by damaging the boat, Khidr was actually protecting it from being taken by the king.

Next, the two men came across a young boy whom Khidr killed without any apparent reason. Musa was outraged and questioned Khidr's actions, but Khidr once again explained that the boy's parents were righteous believers, and if he had been allowed to live, he would have grown up to be an evil person who would have caused them great grief and hardship.

Finally, they arrived at a town where the people refused to give them any hospitality. They came across a wall that was in a state of disrepair, and Khidr proceeded to fix it without asking for payment. Musa once again questioned Khidr's actions, but Khidr explained that the wall belonged to two orphan boys whose father was a righteous man. Beneath the wall was a treasure that the boys' father had left for them. If the wall had collapsed, the treasure would have been exposed and stolen by the town's people, leaving the boys with nothing.

At the end of their journey, Khidr revealed to Musa that the reason he had done these apparently strange things was because Allah had granted him knowledge of things that Musa did not know. Musa realized that he had learned valuable lessons about trust, patience, and submission to Allah's will.

This story serves as a reminder that sometimes we may not understand the wisdom behind Allah's actions, but we should trust in His plan and have faith that everything happens for a greater purpose. It also emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and learning from those who may be more knowledgeable than us, as Musa did with Khidr.

> ## L Lessons

Patience: The story of Prophet Musa and Khidr teaches us the importance of patience in our journey towards seeking knowledge and understanding. Musa was eager to learn from Khidr, but he had to be patient and trust in Allah's plan, even when things seemed to go wrong.

Submission to Allah's will: The story of Musa and Khidr also emphasizes the importance of submitting to Allah's will and accepting that we may not always understand His plan. Sometimes, what seems to be a loss or a setback may actually be a blessing in disguise, as Allah knows what is best for us.

Seeking knowledge: Finally, the story of Musa and Khidr highlights the importance of seeking knowledge and wisdom, and being open to learning from those who may be more knowledgeable than us. Ramadan is a time for spiritual growth and self-improvement, and we should strive to increase our knowledge and understanding of Islam during this blessed month.


> The story of Prophet Musa and Khidr can be found in Surah Al-Kahf (The Cave), which is the 18th chapter of the Quran. It starts from verse 60 and ends at verse 82."
